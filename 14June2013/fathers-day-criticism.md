## Best Father's Day Gift: Criticism

SFSU Psychology Professor Jeff Cookston encourages dads to ask children for feedback on how they're parenting.  His research suggests that kids perceive their father's parenting differently than intended.  "You may think that you’re being a good parent by not being harsh on your kid, for instance, but your child may view that as 'you’re not invested in me, you’re not trying.'" said Cookston.

Cookston's work relates mostly to adolescents, but I decided to try his suggestion out with my 4 year old son.  "I don't know" was his response to "Am I doing a good job as a father?".  "Ok, that makes sense", I said, "I guess you don't have any other Dad for comparison".  "No only you, Dad!", he said, surprising me with a big smile and a hug that brought a tear to my eye.  I persisted, asking if there were ways I could improve as a parent.  He told me he wanted me to fight more often, specifically with his a friend from his pre-school class.  I told him I'd take it under consideration, but there's no way I'm going to mess with someone who wears a superman t-shirt every day.

  "Well are there things you think I could be doing better as a parent?", I persisted.  "Fighting!" was his instant reply.  "You want me to fight more?"  "Yes!"  "Who do you want me to fight?"  "Owen" (his friend from school).  



  This suggestion is based on his research olooks at how kids perceive their fathers' parenting behavior.

Just being a good parent may not be good enough, said Cookston, professor of psychology, who has studied fatherhood extensively. "There's a need for fathers to sometimes say to their kids, 'How am I doing? Am I the dad you need me to be?'"

"Kids are actively trying to make sense of the parenting they receive," he explained, "and the meaning that children take from the parenting may be as important, or more important, than the behavior of the parents."
"I don't think a lot of parents give these ideas about meaning much thought," 


The meanings that adolescents in particular attach to their fathers' behavior can vary depending on the child's gender, ethnicity, and the presence of a stepfather in the child’s life, Cookston and former SF State graduate student Andrea Finlay report in a new study published in the Journal of Family Issues. The study included children from California and Arizona.
