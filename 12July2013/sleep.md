## Go The F*ck To Sleep Or Else Be Dumb

Kids who had irregular bedtimes on school nights at ages 3,5, and 7 underperformed in reading, math, and spatial ability tests taken at age 7, according to a [study by University College London](
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-08/irregular-bedtimes-tied-to-children-s-lower-test-scores.html "Irregular Bedtimes Tied to Childrenâ€™s Lower Test Scores") that was widely reported this week. The study shows correlation but not causation, perhaps not adding much to the already established facts about the importance of sleep in kids' mental and emotional functioning. Po Bronson's New York Magazine "Snooze Or Loose" for a great overview of children's sleep research.
