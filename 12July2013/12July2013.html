<p>Kids with irregular bedtimes on school nights at ages 3,5, and 7 underperformed in reading, math, and spatial ability tests taken at age 7, according to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-08/irregular-bedtimes-tied-to-children-s-lower-test-scores.html" title="Irregular Bedtimes Tied to Childrenâ€™s Lower Test Scores">study by University College London</a> widely reported this week. The study shows correlation but not causation, perhaps not adding much to the already established facts about the importance of sleep in kids' mental and emotional functioning. See Po Bronson's <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/38951/" title="Snooze or Loose by Po Bronson">"Snooze Or Loose"</a> in New York Magazine for a great overview of children's sleep research.</p>

<h2>The Quanitifed Kid Movement</h2>
<p style="float: left; clear: left">If you were concerned that your kids might be left out of the wearable computing and the quantified self megatrends, you can rest easy. You'll soon be able to get <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/a-digital-diaper-for-tracking-health/" title="A Digital Diaper For Tracking Children's Health">digital diapers that analyze</a> for dehydration, infection, kidney problems, and other health issues. Need inspiration on how to apply big data to parenting, see <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/data_mine_1/2013/07/data_driven_parenting_tracking_baby_sleep_eating_and_pooping_on_spreadsheets.single.html">"I Measure Every Single Thing My Child Does"</a> by Slate's Amy Webb: <em>To you, our data tracking might seem obsessive, ostentatious, or just plain weird. Let me offer some perspective.  Our data tracking - and we're still doing it, years later - is how we pay deep, sincere attention to our child. And I have tangible proof that it's working.</em></p>
