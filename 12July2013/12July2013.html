<p>Stanford researchers have found that <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/july/kids-healthy-eating-070313.html" title="Kids eat more vegetables after nutrition lessons, Stanford study finds">young children are capable of understanding a conceptual approach to nutrition</a>. Their nutrition storybooks doubled voluntary consumption of vegetables.  "What sets our materials apart from other approaches is the care we took to explain to children why their body needs different kinds of healthy food. We did not train children to eat more vegetables specifically," the researchers said. No word yet on how well this approach competes with pretending your kids are giants eating "trees" of broccoli.</p>
<p>The Atlantic's Lindsay Abrams reports that children struggling with obesity respond best when <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/06/study-when-talking-to-kids-about-obesity-focus-on-foods-not-body-shapes/277173/" title="Study: When Talking to Kids About Obesity, Focus on Foods, Not Body Shapes">emphasis is placed on healthy diet instead of their body shape</a>.</p>

<p>Kids with irregular bedtimes on school nights at ages 3,5, and 7 underperformed in reading, math, and spatial ability tests taken at age 7, according to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-08/irregular-bedtimes-tied-to-children-s-lower-test-scores.html" title="Irregular Bedtimes Tied to Childrenâ€™s Lower Test Scores">study by University College London</a> widely reported this week. The study shows correlation but not causation, perhaps not adding much to the already established facts about the importance of sleep in kids' mental and emotional functioning. See Po Bronson's <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/38951/" title="Snooze or Loose by Po Bronson">"Snooze Or Loose"</a> in New York Magazine for a great overview of children's sleep research.</p>

Let me offer some perspective.  Our data tracking - and we're still doing it, years later - is how we pay deep, sincere attention to our child. And I have tangible proof that it's working.</em></p>
