<p>Temple professor Jordan Shapiro writes in Medium about what his 8-year-old experienced at video game creation summer camp, making a powerful argument for how designing play helps kids develop higher-order thinking. He also summarizes the landscape of products and organizations that encourage this kind of experience.

<p>Stanford researchers have found that <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/july/kids-healthy-eating-070313.html" title="Kids eat more vegetables after nutrition lessons, Stanford study finds">young children are capable of understanding a conceptual approach to nutrition</a>. They used nutrition storybooks that doubled voluntary consumption of vegetables.  "What sets our materials apart from other approaches is the care we took to explain to children why their body needs different kinds of healthy food. We did not train children to eat more vegetables specifically." No word yet on how well this approach competes with pretending your kids are giants gobbling up "trees" of broccoli.</p>
<p>The Atlantic's Lindsay Abrams reports that children struggling with obesity respond best when <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/06/study-when-talking-to-kids-about-obesity-focus-on-foods-not-body-shapes/277173/" title="Study: When Talking to Kids About Obesity, Focus on Foods, Not Body Shapes">emphasis is placed on healthy diet instead of their body shape</a>.</p>

<p>Kids with irregular bedtimes on school nights at ages 3,5, and 7 underperformed in reading, math, and spatial ability tests taken at age 7, according to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-08/irregular-bedtimes-tied-to-children-s-lower-test-scores.html" title="Irregular Bedtimes Tied to Childrenâ€™s Lower Test Scores">study by University College London</a> widely reported this week. The study shows correlation but not causation, perhaps not adding much to the already established facts about the importance of sleep in kids' mental and emotional functioning. See Po Bronson's <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/38951/" title="Snooze or Loose by Po Bronson">"Snooze Or Loose"</a> in New York Magazine for a great overview of children's sleep research.</p>

If you were concerned that your toddler might be left out of the wearable computing megatrend, you can rest easy. You'll soon be able to get <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/a-digital-diaper-for-tracking-health/" title="A Digital Diaper For Tracking Children's Health">digital diapers that analyze</a> for dehydration, infection, kidney problems, and other health issues. So the first step in diapers acquiring intelligence is to jump straight to medical school? What about basic skills like stain removal or alerting proper authorities when you've malfunctioned and are about to drop your payload all over the floor?</p>
<p>Need inspiration on how to apply quantified self principles to parenting, see <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/data_mine_1/2013/07/data_driven_parenting_tracking_baby_sleep_eating_and_pooping_on_spreadsheets.single.html">"I Measure Every Single Thing My Child Does"</a> by Slate's Amy Webb: <em>To you, our data tracking might seem obsessive, ostentatious, or just plain weird. Let me offer some perspective.  Our data tracking - and we're still doing it, years later - is how we pay deep, sincere attention to our child. And I have tangible proof that it's working.</em></p>
