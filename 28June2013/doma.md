## What End of DOMA Means For Families

This week the US Supreme Court Struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 law preventing the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage.  What this means to parents and kids:

1. Equal rights for children of same-sex parents. According to Justice Anthony Kennedy, DOMA "humiliates children being raised by same sex couples and makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives."
