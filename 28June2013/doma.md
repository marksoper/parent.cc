## What The End Of DOMA Means For Families

This week the US Supreme Court Struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 law preventing the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage.  The impact on families:

1. Same-sex parents now receive equal spousal treatment in federal matters:  taxes, Family and Medical Leave Act benefits, benefits for federal employees including military/veterans, social security, Medicaid, etc.  It's expected to eliminate the extra $1000 per year in federal taxes same-sex couples pay and potentially much more in unequal estate tax treatment.  Some changes may go into effect gradually as they're implemented.  


Dignity - Equal rights for children of same-sex parents. According to Justice Anthony Kennedy, DOMA "humiliates children being raised by same sex couples and makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives."
