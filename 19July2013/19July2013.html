Totally revolutionizing my perspective on Chuck E. Cheese's, The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/chuck-e-cheeses-silicon-valley-startup-the-origins-of-the-best-pizza-chain-ever/277869/" title="Chuck E. Cheese's, Silicon Valley Startup: The Origins of the Best Pizza Chain Ever">interviews the founder to tell the remarkable story of the pizza arcade chain</a>. Nolan Bushnell, from his vantage point as founder of Atari, saw better economics on the arcade side so he personally constructed everything from animatronic characters to pizza recipes to create the ultimate birthday venue for generations of kids.</p>

<p>Early childhood behavior, long suspected of being linked to <em>parental</em> drinking, may also relate to alchohol problems for the child later in life. A research study at VCU sugggests that <a href="http://news.vcu.edu/news/Preschool_Personality_May_Predict_Teenage_Alcohol_Use" title="Preschool Personality May Predict Teenage Alcohol Use">early childhood personality may increase risk of future alchohol problems</a>. Kids with behavioral problems are at risk, kids who are "consistently social" at even greater risk. The group at highest risk by a wide margin: Kids who could reliably bounce a quarter off the table into a plastic cup.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 15px">More Evidence Against Physical Punishment</h2>
<p>Speaking of old-school parenting, University of Manitoba <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/07/02/physical-punishment-increases-your-kids-risk-of-mental-illness/#ixzz2ZW4oeAHq">researchers surveyed thousands of American adults, asking whether they had experienced "pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping and hitting"</a>. Those who had were more likely to have experienced nearly every type of mental illness and drug abuse. George Holden, a professor of psychology at Southern Methodist University says this study fits into a "large constellation" of studies that show children whose parents use physical force are at greater risk for depression and anxiety. Yet still 80% of American parents rely on corporal punishment to some extent.</p>
