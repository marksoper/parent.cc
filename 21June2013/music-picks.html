<h2>Music Picks for Sing-Along, Dancing, and Baby Relaxation</h2>

<p>At our son&#39;s preschool graduation ceremony this week the teachers revealed one of their secrets to entertaining a gang of 4-year-olds.  After handing out diplomas they turned the event into a sing-along and dance party just like they&#39;ve done in class all year.  They started out with the kids seated in a circle singing along to a couple of tracks from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vol-2-We-All-Live-Together/dp/B00000AG62" title="We All Live Together by Greg &amp; Steve">We All Live Together Vol 2 by Greg &amp; Steve</a>, and then they busted out Go Baby Go by the Baby Loves Jazz Band and had the whole crew up and grooving, jumping around, and even breakdancing.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a more soothing sound for newborns or in utero audiophiles, check out the recently released Jazz For Babies Vibraphone Album by Michael Janisch.</p>
